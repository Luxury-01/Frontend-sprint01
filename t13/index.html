    <h1>Iron Man</h1>

      <p>
        Genius inventor Tony Stark continued his father Howard Stark’s weaponry
        business after his parents’ untimely deaths and flew it to even greater
        heights of innovation. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile
        for the U.S. military, Stark’s convoy came under fire by a terrorist
        group known as the Ten Rings and he was severely wounded. Taken prisoner
        by the group, Stark awoke in their headquarters to learn that shrapnel
        near his heart had nearly cost him his life, but swift action by
        scientist and fellow prisoner Ho Yinsen—who had inserted a powerful
        electromagnet in Stark’s chest—would prolong it temporarily.</p> <p>
        Stalling his captors after they demanded he build them a new weapon,
        Stark replaced the magnet with the RT, a miniature version of a device
        originally designed by his father, the Arc Reactor. Furthermore, he and
        Yinsen created a crude suit of armor which could provide them the means
        with which to escape.</p>
        <p>The suit worked as planned, though Yinsen sacrificed himself in order to
        allow Tony enough time to power it up to fight their terrorist captors.
        Iron Man (Tony Stark) With help from his friend Lt. Colonel James
        Rhodes, the inventor returned home and promptly announced Stark
        Industries departure from the weapons business.</p>
        <p> His personal assistant Pepper Potts backed the sudden course reversal,
        but his father’s old friend and business partner, Obadiah Stane,
        strongly disagreed with what he saw as a rash decision. Stark worked
        overtime in his lab to streamline the armor, and when he’d finished, a
        new persona emerged: Iron Man.
        After he discovered Stane had illegally sold Stark weapons to the Ten
        Rings, he donned the armor to return to Afghanistan and stop the group
        from using them. Later, he also learned that Stane had paid the Ten
        Rings to kill him and had been working behind Stark’s back to steal the
        entire company.</p> <p>The older man then forcibly took the RT from Tony’s
        chest and left his old friend’s son to die. But, Potts helped Stark
        insert his original, cobbled-together RT into his chest, and Iron Man
        flew again. Stane presented himself in a gigantic suit of armor of his
        own, and a battle ensued until Stark and Potts overloaded Stane’s power
        source and Stane died in the process. Feeling more confident in himself
        than ever before, Stark called a press conference soon after the fight
        and impulsively announced to the world that he was indeed Iron Man.
        </p> <p> At the very core of the Iron Man technology lies the Arc Reactor.
        Designed by Howard Stark, but augmented and strengthened by Tony Stark,
        the Reactor provides a clean, manageable energy source with incredible
        output, one that can be adapted to most anything. At first a large piece
        of equipment, the younger Stark miniaturized the technology into the
        “RT,” which was the size of a human heart, and put it to great use to
        power his suits of armor.

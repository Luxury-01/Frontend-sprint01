    <h2> <a id="super">What makes a superhero?</a> </h2>
        <p> A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. 
            So in order to be a superhero,<b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. 
            Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.</p> 
        <p>    
            For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. 
            But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. 
            If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>
